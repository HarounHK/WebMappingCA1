 Project Description
#####################

The Parking Finder application is a location-based service designed to help users locate available parking lots across Ireland. Users can view all parking locations on an interactive map and search for specific lots,
making it easier to find parking near their destination. 

######################
 Project Requirements
######################

Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS 
Database Management: PgAdmin4     
Backend (Middle Tier): Django    
Frontend: Responsive web application with a user-friendly interface using Bootstrap 5 
Mapping Service: Leaflet JS with OpenStreetMap    
Deployment: Dockerized components deployed on a cloud-facing virtual machine with an SSL certificate

Create/store/manipulate spatial data, hence PostgreSQL/PostGIS.
Create a middle layer based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, hence Django. 
Create an application, usable on any platform, hence responsive design. 
Be accessible securely from the Web, hence cloud deployment

 What would I add if I had more time:
########################################

If I had more time I would add a feature to allow user to add parking lots to favourites section and to be able to access them when needed. I would also keep trying to deploy the application using a domain.
